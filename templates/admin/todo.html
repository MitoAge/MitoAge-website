		<li> Integrate DNA process algorithm in the admin <br/> </li> 
		<br/>
		<li> Statistics - aggregation <br/> </li> 
		<br/>
		<li> Consider making taxonomy more flexible - to include more fields (but keep in mind that flattening it comes with some disadvantages) <br/> </li> 
		<br/>
		<li> Consider making a spin-off project to predict maximum lifespan (check if a inter-lab grant can be obtained = main question why it would be useful?) <br/> </li> 
		<br/>
		
		<li> search in any taxa (now only in species) <br/> </li> 
		<br/>
		
		<li> implement more check tests in the admin (for example: bc full of 0s, or only 1 field in bc is None, warnings for missing fields)<br/> </li>

		<li> Maybe move computation for per 1kb and % to a template tag? More generic like that...<br/> </li> 
		<br/>
		<li> To finish pagination in search<br/> </li> 
		<br/>
		<li> <b>compute AA frequencies from codon entry</b><br/> </li>
