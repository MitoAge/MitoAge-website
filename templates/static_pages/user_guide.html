	<h4>Searching and browsing</h4>
	<p>MitoAge offers several possibilities for you to navigate through the available species and taxa. 
	To search, you may type keywords or phrases relating to the species' common or scientific name that you wish to find. 
	A paginated list of species available in our database is provided. Note that the search is case insensitive.
	</p>
	
	<p>Browsing can be done in 2 ways: 1) though the taxonomic relationships, in which case, at each step you will have to 
	choose classes, orders, families and finally species in order to reach the desired mtDNA information sections, or 2) starting from genes, 
	in which case, you will also be able to browse through taxa, but you will be presented only with stats (see next section) for the entire 
	taxonomic gropus. 
	
	<br/><br/></p>
	
	<h4>Stats for species of interest</h4>
	<p>When browsing through the taxa (or through the genes), basic sequence statistics for any taxonomic groups are also made available.
	The difference between the 2 ways of browsing can be seen in terms of stats. When browsing through genes, only the stats specific 
	to that gene are available. Contrastly, browsing taxa directly allows viewing sections for each of the regions of interest of the mtDNA.

	<h4>Downloading and using the data off-website</h4>
	<p>In order to perform more complex, comparative analyses, the website allows downloading the entire datasets. This can be done from 
	the Download page. A built counter and a built release date are provided to keep track of different database versions.</p>
