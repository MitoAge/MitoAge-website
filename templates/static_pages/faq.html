	<p class="lead"><b>Q: </b>What can I find in MitoAge?</p>
	<p class="lead"><b>A: </b>MitoAge contains calculated mtDNA compositional features of the entire mitochondrial genome, mtDNA coding (tRNA, rRNA, protein-coding genes) and 
	non-coding (D-loop, insertions) regions, codon usage for each protein-coding gene, and longevity records for over 900 species from all taxa of the 
	Animalia kingdom.<br/><br/></p>
	
	<p class="lead"><b>Q: </b>How do I search for entries?</p>
	<p class="lead"><b>A: </b>To look for entries you may use the free form search input field at the top of the website. <br/><br/></p>
	
	<p class="lead"><b>Q: </b>How can I download the specific dataset?</p>
	<p class="lead"><b>A: </b>Unfortunately, at this moment it is not possible to export a certain taxon, species or a certain region only. However, 
	this feature is currently under development and will become available soon. In the meantime, the possibility to download data for a certain
	mtDNA region exists.<br/><br/></p>
	
	<p class="lead"><b>Q: </b>How can I download the whole database?</p>
	<p class="lead"><b>A: </b>Please go to the Download page. You will have the option of downloading the entire database. <br/><br/></p>
	
	<p class="lead"><b>Q: </b>What statistics fuctions are available for taxonomic groups?</p>
	<p class="lead"><b>A: </b>Min, max, averageÂ±SD, median and range (minimum, maximum) are provided for any taxonomic group. 
	Additionally, the Spearman correlation coefficient of maximum lifespan with selected mtDNA characteristics is also computed.<br/><br/></p>
	
	<p class="lead"><b>Q: </b>Where can I find more mtDNA information (e.g. relevant data on metabolic rate and body temperature</p>
	<p class="lead"><b>A: </b>More data related to longevity in animals can be found at AnAge, a curated database of ageing and life 
	history in animals.<br/><br/></p>
	
	<p class="lead"><b>Q: </b>I cannot find info on the gene in searched results.  What to do?</p>
	<p class="lead"><b>A: </b>Firstly, please check again the name of the gene. 
	Second, check the alternative gene names (aliases) in our database. 
	Lastly, please keep in mind that there are given species in which not all the gene exist.
